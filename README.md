# sysck
A script which checks for tools required to build Linux From Scratch, with additional checks added by me.

# greset.sh
A script to reset the system fonts on Pop-OS (installed on my System76 Oryx Pro). For some reason I have had to do this three times already and was tired of looking up the commands repeatedly.

# dir_colors.sh
A script to display the dircolors used by bash. This shows the system defaults from dircolor -p and the user settings if ~/.dircolors exits. It also shows the color numbers used for each example.
